            <p>This program is designed for full-time faculty who have never led a study abroad program before but who would
              like to gain experience in order to apply to lead a short-term program with Valencia students in the future.
              The following outlines the steps to apply and the requirements of program participation. Participants will
              select a short-term study abroad program to go on the first year as a mentee to learn what is involved in leading
              a study abroad program the following year. Watch this<a href="http://youtu.be/sZdNigNiI-s" target="_blank"> video on one professor's perspective</a>              on what it is like to mentor.</p>
